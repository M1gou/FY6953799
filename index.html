  <p>
    AI is steadily transforming aviation, promising a safer and more sustainable future. 
    By combining human expertise with AI’s ability to analyze vast amounts of data, 
    the industry is entering a new era of collaboration between humans and intelligent systems. 
    This paper explores how AI supports predictive maintenance, air traffic optimization, 
    and safety enhancement, while addressing challenges such as data privacy, 
    algorithmic bias, and cybersecurity. AI emerges as a key driver of a greener, safer aviation future.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The Aviation industry faces a growing problem: climate change is happening and companies need to update themselves accordingly. Following that more and more people want to fly in the skies so there's more planes in the skies and that increases the chances of having more accidents. 
    By incorporating AI in this vast industry it will allow companies to analyse a vast amount of information and spot patterns that humans might take longer to see or even overlook. AI can support smarter, faster, and more precise decision-making.
    Beyond the benefits of AI in safety, that we must give a chance to trust, it also offers the potential to reduce fuel-consumption and emissions making airlines save millions of pounds.
    In this essay I will discuss how AI is transforming our skies by making it greener and safer. (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023; Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024).  
  </p>

  <h3 id="Paragraph1">The Current Landscape of Aviation Decision-Making</h3>
  <p>
    Ever since people have been using planes it has always depended on human control. Pilots follow checklist, engineers perform maintenances, and air traffic controllers coordinate the flights manually. 
    Even though the risk of accidents in aviation are very low, making it the safest transport system in the world they still do happen. Traditionally, decision-making in aviation has relied on tried-and-true methods that don’t always make full use of the wealth of data modern aircraft can provide.(Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023). 
    For example, flight paths are usually planned in advance rather than adapted dynamically in response to real-time conditions the only thing that could really happen is that flights would be delayed. Which illustrates how opportunities to use data for smarter decisions can be missed (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). Relying only on human judgement can introduce certain risks. People can experience fatigue, time pressure, and information overload—especially in fast-paced environments like air traffic control. These factors can affect performance and lead to delays or errors (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024). 
    Modern aircraft produce huge amounts of information that are difficult to analyse manually and at a high cadence, but AI can process this data instantly to support decision-making. AI can therefore help the industry in making decisions faster and provide a second opinion (Hirosawa et al., 2024). 
  </p>

  <h3 id="Paragraph2">AI in Action: Real-World Applications</h3>
  <p>
Traditional aircraft maintenances have always followed fixed schedules, which can either waste resources or miss early signs of wear. 
Introducing AI could predict when maintenance would be due before it becomes an actual threat to the aircraft. Engineers can then perform maintenance before issues become serious, reducing delays and improving everyone's safety (Hirosawa et al., 2024). 
Advanced Health Monitoring Systems (AHMS), which combine AI with IoT sensors (small devices that help monitor and optimize processes automatically), help to extend component life and make operations more efficient (Kabashkin et al., 2024). AI can also help in flight optimisation making everyone's life easier. Firstly, it's a win for the passenger as the flight won't take as long and the plane will reduce fuel consumption and therefore reduce emissions at the same time.
It would then be a huge economical profit because companies spend billions on fuel every year. By using real-time weather data, air traffic information, and aircraft performance metrics, AI can suggest the most efficient routes. Therefore creating a virtuous loop (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). Machine learning systems continuously adapt to changing conditions, improving decisions mid-flight rather than relying on pre-planned routes (Hirosawa et al., 2024). As more and more people continuously want to use planes tto travel there will consequently be a bigger need for air traffic management. 
For the moment, air traffic management depends on humans monitoring a large number of aircrafts, but by incorporating AI it will be able to predict air traffic congestions and therefore recommend more efficient routes (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).
As AI would be able to improve fuel consumption, systems could predict the exact of fuel needed for a flight leading on to a lighter and greener plane (Kabashkin et al., 2024). 
  </p>

  <h3 id="Paragraph3">Enhancing Safety and Sustainability</h3>
  <p>
    AI enhances safety through predictive risk assessment and helps the environment by reducing unnecessary fuel burn. 
    Smarter routing and optimized flight paths reduce emissions, supporting aviation’s goal of net-zero carbon by 2050.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Paragraph4">Challenges and the Future</h3>
  <p>
    Despite the promise, AI adoption faces challenges like data privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical concerns. 
    Future systems must balance automation with human oversight to maintain safety and public trust.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The integration of AI in aviation marks a new chapter in flight safety and sustainability. 
    With careful development and regulation, AI can make the skies not just smarter—but safer and greener for generations to come.
