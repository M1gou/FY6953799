  <!-- Abstract -->
  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    There is a very bright future concerning the integration of advanced technological system such AI, machine learning and deep learning. 
    AI promises a safer and greener future, can you imagine planes having the ability to predict and prevent accidents? By combining human expertise and AI's ability to process vast amounts of information quickly, the aviation industry is entering a new era of co-piloting between humans and technology. 
    Machine's would be able to detect patterns where humans would take a much longer time to notice. Therefore it allows decision makers to act faster and more accurately than ever before. 
    As AI is still at the beginning of its development, humans still need to rigorously test these systems and carefully regulated to ensure safety, trust and reliability. AI doesn't only come down to its technology but also about creating a more efficient safer, and greener future for everyone who takes the skies. 
  </p>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The Aviation industry faces a growing problem: climate change is happening and companies need to update themselves accordingly. Following that more and more people want to fly in the skies so there's more planes in the skies and that increases the chances of having more accidents. 
    By incorporating AI in this vast industry it will allow companies to analyse a vast amount of information and spot patterns that humans might take longer to see or even overlook. AI can support smarter, faster, and more precise decision-making.
    Beyond the benefits of AI in safety, that we must give a chance to trust, it also offers the potential to reduce fuel-consumption and emissions making airlines save millions of pounds.
    In this essay I will discuss how AI is transforming our skies by making it greener and safer. (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023; Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024).  
  </p>
  
<h3 id="Paragraph1">The Current Landscape of Aviation Decision-Making</h3>
  <p>
    Ever since people have been using planes it has always depended on human control. Pilots follow checklist, engineers perform maintenances, and air traffic controllers coordinate the flights manually. 
    Even though the risk of accidents in aviation are very low, making it the safest transport system in the world they still do happen. Traditionally, decision-making in aviation has relied on tried-and-true methods that don’t always make full use of the wealth of data modern aircraft can provide.(Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023). 
    For example, flight paths are usually planned in advance rather than adapted dynamically in response to real-time conditions the only thing that could really happen is that flights would be delayed. Which illustrates how opportunities to use data for smarter decisions can be missed (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). Relying only on human judgement can introduce certain risks. People can experience fatigue, time pressure, and information overload—especially in fast-paced environments like air traffic control. These factors can affect performance and lead to delays or errors (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024). 
    Modern aircraft produce huge amounts of information that are difficult to analyse manually and at a high cadence, but AI can process this data instantly to support decision-making. AI can therefore help the industry in making decisions faster and provide a second opinion (Hirosawa et al., 2024). 
  </p>

<h3 id="Paragraph2">AI in Action: Real-World Applications</h3>
  <p>
Traditional aircraft maintenances have always followed fixed schedules, which can either waste resources or miss early signs of wear. 
Introducing AI could predict when maintenance would be due before it becomes an actual threat to the aircraft. Engineers can then perform maintenance before issues become serious, reducing delays and improving everyone's safety (Hirosawa et al., 2024). 
Advanced Health Monitoring Systems (AHMS), which combine AI with IoT sensors (small devices that help monitor and optimize processes automatically), help to extend component life and make operations more efficient (Kabashkin et al., 2024). AI can also help in flight optimisation making everyone's life easier. Firstly, it's a win for the passenger as the flight won't take as long and the plane will reduce fuel consumption and therefore reduce emissions at the same time.
It would then be a huge economical profit because companies spend billions on fuel every year. By using real-time weather data, air traffic information, and aircraft performance metrics, AI can suggest the most efficient routes. Therefore creating a virtuous loop (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). Machine learning systems continuously adapt to changing conditions, improving decisions mid-flight rather than relying on pre-planned routes (Hirosawa et al., 2024). As more and more people continuously want to use planes tto travel there will consequently be a bigger need for air traffic management. 
For the moment, air traffic management depends on humans monitoring a large number of aircrafts, but by incorporating AI it will be able to predict air traffic congestions and therefore recommend more efficient routes (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).
As AI would be able to improve fuel consumption, systems could predict the exact of fuel needed for a flight leading on to a lighter and greener plane (Kabashkin et al., 2024). 
  </p>

  <h3 id="Paragraph3">Enhancing Safety and Sustainability</h3>
  <p>
 Newly developed AI algorithms can identify small changes in aircraft data such as engine vibrations or even mechanical problems (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024).
Maintenance teams can therefore detect these problems early and avoid failures to occur and subsequently accidents too. This allows airline companies to save time and millions of pounds for repair charges (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023). AI can have a crucial role in both the cockpit and on the ground. 
It helps to analyse real-time flight data and environmental conditions, providing quick recommendations during emergencies or unexpected situations (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024). This helps pilots and controllers make safer and faster decisions. From an environmental point of view, AI supports sustainability by helping airlines reduce emissions through more efficient routes and fuel use.
It can also support the development of electric and hybrid aircraft by optimising energy use and battery performance (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023). These technologies show how the pilots decision-making can support the wider goal of sustainable aviation (McManners, 2017). 
  </p>

<h3 id="Paragraph4">Challenges and the Future</h3>
  <p>
     

AI is definitively a growing topic in the industry, many countries around the world have started their research on how AI could help with safety. The graph below shows how the research has increased over time:  
There clearly has been a significant increase in publications over recent years. While only having 13 publications in 2020, this number rose to 68 in 2023. That's just a little bit more than five times as much publications in the space of three years. The significant growth in such a short period of time shows how advanced technological methods, such as AI, machine learning, and deep learning have been a growing matter for evryone acorss the world. (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024). 
 
    <!-- Charts -->
  <div id="chart_div"></div>
  <div id="line_chart_div"></div>

From country to country the number of publications tend to differ, it also comes to show which countries are putting more research into and which aren't.  
According to the figure below, Europe is clearly falling back behind the USA and China. The table shows the countries broadcasting aviation safety. China is the most active Country in aviation safety, with 464 publications. China has collaborated extensively with Hong Kong, the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom in aviation safety studies, demonstrating a global effort to integrate AI and Machine Learning techniques into aviation safety (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).  

<!-- Example Tables -->
  <table>
  <caption>Country Productivity in Aviation Safety Studies</caption>
  <tr><th>Country</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Country</th><th>Frequency</th></tr>
  <tr><td>China</td><td>464</td><td>Austria</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>USA</td><td>182</td><td>Brazil</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Italy</td><td>30</td><td>Japan</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>India</td><td>20</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Turkey</td><td>14</td><td>Finland</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>UK</td><td>13</td><td>Croatia</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Portugal</td><td>12</td><td>Iceland</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Canada</td><td>10</td><td>Pakistan</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>France</td><td>9</td><td>Saudi Arabia</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Iran</td><td>9</td><td>Iraq</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Israel</td><td>8</td><td>Singapore</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>South Korea</td><td>8</td><td>Angola</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Germany</td><td>7</td><td>Colombia</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Australia</td><td>6</td><td>Ireland</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Belgium</td><td>6</td><td>Kenya</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>6</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Poland</td><td>6</td><td>United Arab Emirates</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Spain</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table> 

The final example is how countries share the information between themselves, with once again USA and China having the most connections throughout the entire world. This relation can be seen through a cooperation map.  
The dark blue indicates countries that publish a lot, blue indicates countries that publish less, and gray indicates countries that do not. The thickness of the brown line used for cooperation between countries represents the strength of the relationship. It is seen that China cooperates with Hong Kong, the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom in studies related to aviation safety. The United Kingdom collaborates with Germany and Saudi Arabia, facilitating cross-border impacts of AI-based research. These collaborations indicate that the influence of AI and Machine Learning on aviation safety is being addressed globally.  
Companies are currently or keep developing science mapping software's that allows them to help researches see how ideas in aviation AI are connected and where new trends are emerging. The table below shows some of these software's including their strength and weaknesses. Examples include, VOSviewer, Biblioshiny and SciMAT. Biblioshiny was used in the study because it is a user-friendly, internet-based application that does not require coding . In addition, VOSviewer was used to create network mapping (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).

  </figure>

  
    The systematic review was used to identify the main structures and focal points of research on aviation safety. The systematic analysis revealed which sub-topics are emphasized, which techniques are used more frequently, and research trends. The main studies can be seen in the table below: 
Although AI offers many benefits, its adoption in aviation still faces challenges. Trust and accountability are major concerns; pilots, engineers, and controllers need to understand how AI systems make their recommendations (Hirosawa et al., 2024). AI should support human judgement, not replace it, which is why most systems follow a human-AI collaboration model (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023).  
    Another issue is data quality. AI systems depend on accurate, unbiased data to make reliable predictions. Poor-quality or incomplete data could lead to wrong decisions (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). To ensure safety and trust, strong regulation and testing are essential before AI is used in critical aviation systems.  

Looking towards the future, the best outcome would be a cohort between humans and advanced technological systems-working together as co-decision makers. By combining human experience with AI’s speed and precision aviation could achieve a key balance to create a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable aviation industry (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).
