  <!-- Abstract -->
  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  <div class="paragraph-box">
    <p>
      There is a very bright future concerning the integration of advanced technological system such AI, machine learning and deep learning. AI promises a safer and greener future, can you imagine planes having the ability to predict and prevent accidents? 
      By combining human expertise and AI's ability to process vast amounts of information quickly, the aviation industry is entering a new era of co-piloting between humans and technology. Machine's would be able to detect patterns where humans would take a much longer time to notice. Therefore it allows decision makers to act faster and more accurately than ever before. 
      As AI is still at the beginning of its development, humans still need to rigorously test these systems and carefully regulated to ensure safety, trust and reliability. AI doesn't only come down to its technology but also about creating a more efficient safer, and greener future for everyone who takes the skies. 
    </p>

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <div class="paragraph-box">
   Climate change is major problem for the aviation industry as it put many new regulations on multinational companies. Above that, more and more people want to take the skies especially since covid-19. Thereby increasing the number of flights, the number of emissions and a higher possibility of accidents.

   By incorporating advanced technological systems, such as AI or machine learning, companies could analyse a very large amount of information and spot patterns that us humans wouldn't necessarily see at first. AI can also think of more fuel efficient flight paths ultimately making airlines save millions of pounds. Anticipating these things plays a crucial role in strategic planning and following environmental regulations (Alipour Bonab et al., 2024). AI is slowly transforming the aviation industry, making are skies safer and greener (Kabashkin, I., Mišņevs, A. & Zervina, T., 2023), (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024).

  <h3 id="Paragraph4">Challenges and the Future</h3>
  <div class="paragraph-box">
    <p>
   Over recent years the research on advanced technological systems in aviation safety has been a growing matter. With only 13 publications in 2020 it has now gone up by more than five times that to 68 in the space of only three years. This reflects the global interest in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. This can be seen in the graph below: 
      <!-- Line Charts -->
    <div id="line_chart_div"></div>
<p>(Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024)</p>

<p>    
In the industry machine learning tends to be the number one way organizations develop there research and AI is slightly less used for safety research. Therefore reflecting the global interest in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. This analysis can be seen in the pie chart below:
</p>
    <p>
  <!--Pie Chart-->
<div id="chart_div"></div>
  </p>
 <p>(Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024) </p>        
<p>Recently many countries have been looking a lot into safety research, if you look at the table below, you can see that European countries lag far behind the USA and China, with China leading in aviation safety research, producing 464 publications. The first European country is Italy with 30 publications, that's more than 15 times less than China. This comes to show Europe's lack of commitment in safety research.

    <p>(Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024)</p>

<p>Many countries tend to also share safety research documents to each other, for example China shares a lot of documents with Hong-Kong, this can be seen in the cooperation map below. Yet the same problem is apparent again. Europe is far behind in terms of documents shared and the lack of investment is a concerning issue (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023).  </p>

    <p>Although AI offers many benefits, its adoption in aviation still faces challenges. Trust and accountability are major concerns; pilots, engineers, and controllers need to understand how AI systems make their recommendations (Hirosawa et al., 2024). AI should support human judgement, not replace it, which is why most systems follow a human-AI collaboration model (Kabashkin, Mišņevs and Zervina, 2023). AI depends on accurate and unbiased data for reliable predictions. Therefore why poor or incomplete data could lead to incorrect decisions (Demir, Moslem and Duleba, 2024). But with strong regulations, rigorous testing , and transparency AI will be able to be fully deployed in critical aviation systems. </p>

But with strong regulations, rigorous testing , and transparency AI will be able to be fully deployed in critical aviation systems. 
 
The ideal future in aviation right now is a co decision making between humans and AI, combining humans expertise and AI's rapid, data-driven precision. This collaboration promises a safer, greener, and more efficient industry while at the same time achieving global long-term environmental goals (Hirosawa et al., 2024). 

 
    
    </p>


    <p>
      From country to country, the number of publications varies. Europe is behind the USA and China. China leads with 464 publications and collaborates extensively globally (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).
    </p>

  

    
    <p>
      Systematic reviews identify research trends, focal points, and commonly used AI techniques. Adoption faces challenges such as trust, accountability, and data quality. Human-AI collaboration is recommended, along with strong regulation and testing (Hirosawa et al., 2024; Kabashkin et al., 2023; Demir et al., 2024).
    </p>

    <p>
      Future development will rely on collaboration between humans and AI systems, combining human experience with AI’s speed and precision to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in aviation (Sharma, Kumar and Singh, 2024).

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <div class="paragraph-box">
    <p>
In conclusion, the future regarding AI in aviation is promising. From predicting early maintenance to route optimisations and even air traffic management, it will help airlines make smarter, 
faster, safer and greener choices. While certain challenges are still imminent around humans trusting AI, it's ability though to support us marks a major step forward in reducing things such as human error, enhance 
efficiency, minimize emissions and much more. The future of aviation will now depend on how well humans and AI can work together to build a safer and more sustainable future.
